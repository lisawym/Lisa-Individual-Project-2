## Rust-Powered Campus Seminar Information Management

**Project Overview:**
The project aims to create a Rust-based CLI application that scrapes seminar information from a campus department website, stores the scraped data in an SQLite database, allows users to query the database based on dates, and optimizes the Rust binary. Below are the detailed steps to achieve this:

**Step 1: Web Scraping (Rust Source Code)**
- Utilize Rust to build a web scraping tool to extract seminar information from the campus department website.
- Comprehensively understand Rust's syntax and unique features.

**Step 2: Database Operations**
- Store the scraped seminar data into an SQLite database.
- Demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

**Step 3: Database Query**
- Create functionality for users to query the database based on specified dates.

**Step 4: GitHub Actions Workflow**
- Implement GitHub Actions to automate various processes.
- Include testing, linting, and building Rust code as part of the workflow.

**Step 5: Binary Optimization**
- Optimize the Rust binary to enhance its performance and efficiency.

**Step 6: Documentation and Demo**
- Create a detailed README.md that explains the project's purpose, dependencies, how to run the program, and how GitHub Copilot was used in the coding process.
- Include a YouTube link in the README.md for a clear and concise video demonstration of the CLI binary.
